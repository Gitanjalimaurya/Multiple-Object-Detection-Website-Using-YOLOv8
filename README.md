Fruitify is a multiple object detection website, which can detect fruits (apple, banana, grape, orange) currently. User can get his/her preferred recipes related to the detected fruits, and can also provide his/her feedback on the website.

Welcome to Fruitify!!

Our project introduces a multifaceted approach to image detection and user interaction,
focusing on the identification of various fruits within uploaded images and providing
tailored recipes based on user preferences. Employing advanced image processing
techniques and machine learning algorithms, our system swiftly detects and labels fruits
within multiple images, offering users an intuitive interface for seamless interaction. Beyond
fruit detection, our platform enhances user engagement through personalized recipe
recommendations. By incorporating user preferences such as taste profiles, dietary
restrictions, and meal preferences, our system curates customized recipe suggestions,
ensuring a delightful culinary experience for every user. Furthermore, our platform
facilitates user feedback, fostering continuous improvement and refinement of both
detection algorithms and recipe recommendations.
